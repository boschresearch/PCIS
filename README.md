# Training Object Detectors if Only Large Objects are Labeled

This repository will hold an implementation of the method called PCIS, i.e.,
“**P**seudo-labels, output **C**onsistency across scales, and an anchor
scale-dependent **I**gnore **S**trategy”. This implementation is the companion
code for the system reported in the paper:  
“Training Object Detectors if Only Large Objects are Labeled” by Daniel
Pototzky et al. (Accepted at BMVC 2021)
